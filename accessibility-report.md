## Applications of Principles of Universal Design in this project
### Principle 1: Equitable Use
Our app ensures equitable use by being free and open-source, making it accessible regardless of the user's financial situation. The absence of a login requirement eliminates barriers, ensuring inclusivity for individuals with varying technical skills or privacy concerns.

### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
The app accommodates a wide variety of users with diverse needs:
- Users can customize recipe searches based on dietary restrictions, calorie ranges, or specific cuisines.
- Features like the random recipe generator provide options for those seeking inspiration or less structured usage.

### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
The graphical user interface (GUI) is designed with clear menus and intuitive navigation, enabling users to:
- Easily select filters for recipes.
- Obtain relevant results without needing technical expertise.

### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
All outputs, such as recipe lists, include clear calorie counts and dietary details, making information readily understandable. Planned features like text-to-speech will further ensure accessibility for users with visual impairments or reading difficulties.


### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
The app minimizes potential user errors through:
- Allowing users to go back and modify their filters or input (e.g., correcting a cuisine selection).
- Providing feedback when no recipes match the search, along with suggestions to adjust filters.

### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
Interacting with the app requires minimal effort:
- Simple clicks to generate recipes or refine searches.
- Streamlined navigation ensures quick and efficient use.

#### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
The app's GUI is designed to function well across devices (e.g., desktops, tablets) with sufficient space for all controls, ensuring ease of access regardless of screen size.

## Facing Users (Those likely to benefit the most):
#### Busy Individuals:
- Students or professionals with limited time who need quick, easy-to-follow recipes.
- Individuals who prefer simplified options over long cooking videos or complex instructions.
#### Health-Conscious Users:
- People managing specific dietary requirements (e.g., keto, gluten-free).
- Those tracking calorie intake for weight management or fitness goals.
#### Home Cooks Seeking Inspiration:
- Users looking for new recipe ideas without the need for in-depth planning.
- Individuals who enjoy the spontaneity of a random recipe generator.

## User may not intersted in this app:
#### Visually Impaired Users (Before Accessibility Updates):
- Until features like text-to-speech are implemented, these users might face challenges accessing recipe details.
#### Highly Advanced Cooks:
- Professionals or experienced chefs may find the app too basic or limiting in scope.
#### User who don't understand English:
- Users who don't speak the app's primary language may face barriers until changing language options are implemented.

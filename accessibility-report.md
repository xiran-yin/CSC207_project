## Accessibility report - Applications of Principles of Universal Design in this project
#### Principle 1: Equitable Use
Your app ensures equitable use by being free and open-source, making it accessible regardless of the user's financial situation. The absence of a login requirement eliminates barriers, ensuring inclusivity for individuals with varying technical skills or privacy concerns.

#### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
The app accommodates a wide variety of users with diverse needs:
- Users can customize recipe searches based on dietary restrictions, calorie ranges, or specific cuisines.
- Features like the random recipe generator provide options for those seeking inspiration or less structured usage.

#### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
The graphical user interface (GUI) is designed with clear menus and intuitive navigation, enabling users to:
- Easily select filters for recipes.
- Obtain relevant results without needing technical expertise.

#### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
All outputs, such as recipe lists, include clear calorie counts and dietary details, making information readily understandable. Planned features like text-to-speech will further ensure accessibility for users with visual impairments or reading difficulties.


#### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
The app minimizes potential user errors through:
- Allowing users to go back and modify their filters or input (e.g., correcting a cuisine selection).
- Providing feedback when no recipes match the search, along with suggestions to adjust filters.

#### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
Interacting with the app requires minimal effort:
- Simple clicks to generate recipes or refine searches.
- Streamlined navigation ensures quick and efficient use.

#### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
The app's GUI is designed to function well across devices (e.g., desktops, tablets) with sufficient space for all controls, ensuring ease of access regardless of screen size.
